Our return policy allows for refunds or exchanges within 30 days of purchase. Unfortunately, if you exceed 30 days from the date of purchase, we will not be able to provide you with a refund or exchange.

1. Unsubscription Service
We grant you the right to unsubscribe at any time, whether through our website or by directly contacting our customer service team to cancel your subscription. Once you decide to unsubscribe, it means that your subscription service will remain effective until the end of the original subscription period, and you can continue to enjoy our paid features.

2. Refund Process
Under certain conditions, you will be eligible to apply for a refund from us within 30 days of purchasing the subscription: if our products and services do not meet your expectations, or for any other reason. Once your refund request is approved, we will return the funds to your account according to your method of payment.

3. Termination of Subscription Service
Once your refund request is approved, your subscription service will be immediately terminated, and you will no longer be able to enjoy our paid services.

If you have any questions about refunds or cancellation of subscriptions, please send an email to ahshengchen@gmail.com.
