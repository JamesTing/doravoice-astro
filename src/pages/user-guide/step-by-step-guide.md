# Step-by-step guide
Now that we've covered the basics, let's jump right in and help you get started with your first DoraVoice mind map on your device.

We'll start simple. You'll learn how to capture your thoughts by writing them down and connecting them. Next, we'll dive into features that will help you structure and re-organize them so that you can gain even more clarity. And last but not least, we'll talk about advanced features like optimizing your workflow, using gestures, and more.

You can follow the instructions on your Mac, iPhone, or iPad. DoraVoice works similarly on all devices, and if not ‚Äî we'll point it out.
